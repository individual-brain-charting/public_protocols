The videos present sequences of visual stimuli at a specific run.  

Two videos are provided for both Theory-of-Mind Localizer and Theory-of-Mind and Pain Matrix Narrative Localizer, since the stimuli was different between runs of the same task. The sequence of stimuli presentation within runs was the same across participants.  

For the Theory-of-Mind and Pain Matrix Movie Localizer, a third video is provided with the presentation of the *Partly Cloudy* movie during one single run.
