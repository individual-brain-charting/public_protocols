Each video presents the sequence of stimuli displayed during one single run. There were 4 different sequences and each of them refers to two possible types (see README.md file in protocol folder for more information). Because each sequence pertains to both visual and audio stimuli, the visual and audio stimuli in type **a** corresponds to the audio and visual stimuli in type **b**, respectively.

Note that, in IBC, we didn't run the 4<sup>th</sup> run tybe **b** and, therefore, the corresponding video annotation is not provided herein.
