## Script for extraction of paradigm descriptors from the *Self* task  

### General instructions  

Author: Ana Luisa Pinho  
e-mail: ana.pinho@inria.fr

Compatibility: Python 2.7 / log files from Expyriment 0.7.0 (Revision 7a6b73d)

The script takes the log files with the extension `.xpd` that are generated by Expyriment under the data folder. Currently, the script accepts the following tree-directory structure for the log files (i.e. the inputs):  
`./sub-<number_of_the_participant_with_two_digits>/<name_of_the_log_file>.xpd`

The tree-directory structure can be changed in the script.

The values of general parameters can be pre-defined on the top of the script.
