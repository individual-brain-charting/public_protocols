Author of the protocol: Ana Luisa Pinho   
email: ana.pinho@inria.fr  

Author of the task: Sarah Genon  

Compatibility: Python 2.7 / Expyriment 0.7.0 (Revision 7a6b73d) or older

To launch the protocol, please run the script `self_ref.py`, as follows:   
`$ python self_ref.py <str_arg_for_gender> <str_arg_for_vs>`

Example:
`$ python self_ref.py male 1`

Make sure the directory with the input files exists. The path of this directory shall be defined in the config file.

In order to select the block number from which the protocol shall start, please note that the numeration starts from 0.
To go back to the main menu, press __h__ key anytime. To leave/pause the experiment, press __ESC__ key anytime.

At the end of each block, i.e. when the corresponding message is displayed, press __ENTER__ to go to the next block. The TTL fixation cross is immediately displayed on the screen. (Note: You don't need to go back to the main menu and launch the protocol for the upcoming block.)

Attention: Do not kill the process with __Ctrl+C__, otherwise the log files are not created. The log files are generated by either running the script till the end or pressing anytime the __ESC__ or the __h__ key. If you're running the protocol under ipython and press __h__ key, the log files are only updated with the latest registries after exiting ipython.
