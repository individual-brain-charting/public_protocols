The videos present, for four runs, the version 1 of the sequence of visual stimuli for male participants. No adjective was repeated between trials and runs. Thus, each run pertained to a unique set of adjectives. The sequence of adjectives in each run was the same for all participants. All sequences were predetermined before launching the protocol. Here, each video refers to one run; the four videos comprehend the four runs included in one single fMRI session for a particular male participant.

Note: There were two different groups of adjectives in this task. One group was presented during the encoding phase and, consequently, as "old" adjectives in the recognition phase. The second one was presented as "new" adjectives in the recognition phase. Groups of adjectives were switched between the two versions of the stimuli. In addition, the stimuli were presented in the lexical form according to the gender of the participant. Therefore, the feminine form of the same set of adjectives was generated as stimuli and two versions for this form were also created. For illustrative purposes, we only provide herein the annotations of version 1 for male participants.
