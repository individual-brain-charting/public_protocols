## Script to generate the inputs for the *RSVP Language* task  

Author: Ana Luisa Pinho

Compatibility: Python 2.7  

To generate the inputs, please run the script `geninputs.py`. 
It will create `cond*` and `inputs*` files. The first ones contain the sentences grouped by category. The second ones contain the sentences in a shuffled order to be used in the protocol held by the script `language.py` (please, check the directory `langexpy_script`).

To generate the files containing a pre-specified sequence according to the category of the sentence (condition) and type of probe per block, please run `sentseq.py`.
