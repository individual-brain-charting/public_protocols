Script to generate the inputs for the RSVP-Language protocol ## Author: Ana Luisa Pinho ## email: ana.pinho@inria.fr

Compatibility: Python 2.7

To generate the inputs, please run the script "geninputs.py". 
It will create "cond*" and "inputs*" files. The first ones contain the sentences grouped by category. The second ones contain the sentences in a shuffled order to be used in the protocol held by the script "language.py" (please, check the directory "langexpy_script").

To generate the files containing a pre-specified sequence according to the category of the sentence (condition) and type of probe per block, please run "sentseq.py".
